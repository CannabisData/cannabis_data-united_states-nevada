> * What exactly do I get with a data download monthly subscription?
>
> For a flat fee of $500 a month you can run as many data reports against any available data sources (Corporations, UCC, etc.) as you wish, with no limitations.  When you run a report with a subscription the order checkout process where you enter your payment is completely skipped and your report is ran immediately.  You will also have the ability with a subscription to configure your reports to run automatically on their own, at any time interval of your choosing, without having to login to your account and manually run the reports.  You can configure a report to run daily, X times a week on any specified days of the week, or X times a month on any specified dates of the month.  If you had an FTP server on your end to auto send the reports to, you could potentially have a fully automated system to transfer data between these two systems with no human intervention necessary.  To start a subscription you can call customer service at 775-684-5708.
