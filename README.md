# Cannabis Data - United States - Nevada

A collection of resources, data, scripts, and Jupyter Notebooks exploring *Cannabis* data from the state of Nevada.

## Usage

This repository is designed to reward exploration.  As [GitHub supports static rendering of Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/blog/1995-github-jupyter-notebooks-3), you can view the repository's `.ipynb` Notebook files directly on GitHub.  For more Notebooks with more dynamic content, you can [preview them on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

You can also clone the repository locally to experiment with the data.  You'll need [`pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) to install the project's requirements:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CannabisData/cannabis_data-united_states-nevada.git
cd cannabis_data-united_states-nevada
pipenv install
pipenv shell
jupyter notebook
```

The last command starts up a local [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/index.html) server and opens the repository root in your browser.  From there you can navigate the repository, open `.ipynb` Notebook files, and experiment at will.
